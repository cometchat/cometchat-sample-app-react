# React Sample App by CometChat

This is a reference application showcasing the integration of [CometChat's React UI Kit](https://www.cometchat.com/docs/ui-kit/react/overview) within a React framework. It provides developers with examples of implementing real-time messaging and voice and video calling features in their own React-based applications.
